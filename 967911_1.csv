Originally the builder's model, this impeccably maintained home blends luxury and practicality. Premium upgrades include matching wood window blinds, ambient lighting in the tray ceiling of the primary suite, and anti-slip upgraded floor tile in the main living areas. The recently remodeled kitchen by Academy is a standout, with high-end cabinets, a coffee bar, Cambria quartz countertops and backsplash, a Frigidaire Professional appliance suite, and a breakfast bar. Adjacent, the spacious living room and formal dining area provide an inviting space for entertaining, while the versatile den/flex room offers additional functionality. The private primary suite features lanai access, a huge walk-in closet, dual vanities, and a walk-in shower with high-end Moen fixtures. Two generously sized guest bedrooms offer ample closet space and share a beautifully updated bath, with matching high-quality cabinetry in the bathrooms and laundry room for a cohesive design. The home boasts several impressive upgrades, including a new roof, soffits, and gutters with extra-wide downspouts, a new hurricane-rated garage door, and a new HVAC system installed in 2024 by Strada. The hot water tank was replaced in 2021, and a new well pump and system was installed in 2021. The septic system was pumped and serviced in January 2025. The outdoor area is perfect for relaxing and entertaining, featuring a completely new pool cage, upgraded paver pool deck, and a 3.5-ton pool heater. The pool equipment is professionally maintained by Water Medic, ensuring the pool remains in pristine condition. The professionally landscaped grounds add to the home's curb appeal. The seller had a pre-listing inspection completed and addressed all minor repairs. No flooding or water damage has ever occurred on the property, and there was no damage from Hurricane Ian except for the pool cage, which has since been replaced. While not in a flood zone, transferable flood insurance is available for additional peace of mind. Additional highlights include upgraded light fixtures and ceiling fans throughout, repurposed kitchen cabinets with an extra refrigerator in the garage, and a home that is truly move-in ready. This exceptional home offers luxury, comfort, and security in a serene, year-round residential neighborhood.""},{""dateSeen"":""2024-12-27T23:10:00.000Z"",""value"":""SELLER IS MOTIVATED, LETS MAKE A DEAL!!!!
